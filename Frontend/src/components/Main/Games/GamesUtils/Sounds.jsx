/**
 * Custom hook that provides game sound effects for various game events.
 * 
 * This hook centralizes all game-related sound effects, making them easily
 * accessible across different game components. It uses the 'use-sound' library
 * to handle audio playback with configurable options.
 * 
 * @returns {Object} An object containing sound effect functions:
 *   - winLevelSound: Plays when player successfully completes a level/game
 *   - loseSound: Plays when player loses the game
 *   - wrongAnswerSound: Plays when player provides an incorrect answer
 *   - opponentStepSound: Plays when opponent makes progress in multiplayer games
 * 
 * @example
 * const { winLevelSound, loseSound, wrongAnswerSound, opponentStepSound } = useGameSounds();
 * 
 * // Play sound when player wins
 * winLevelSound();
 * 
 * // Play sound when player gives wrong answer
 * wrongAnswerSound();
